# SK Tailwind Starter

This is my starter for projects I make with SvelteKit and Tailwind. It uses my conventions and
how I like to build things

## Using

- svelte 4
- sveltekit 2
- tailwind 3

## Usage

```bash
pnpm create svelte@latest your-app-name -e https://github.com/Psypher1/sveltekit-tailwind-starter
```
